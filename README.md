# Kaizen

## Project Overview
Kaizen is a Discord bot for intelligent task management. Named after the Japanese concept of "continuous improvement," this bot aims to help users create, organize, and track tasks directly within Discord, where many already spend significant time communicating and collaborating.

## Vision
The vision for Kaizen is to seamlessly integrate productivity tools into Discord's communication platform, eliminating the need to switch between multiple applications. By leveraging AI capabilities, Kaizen will not only manage tasks but also intelligently assist users in organizing their work and improving their productivity over time.
